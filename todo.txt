Done
* Created japp,jcli,jsessions,jconsole
* Demo basic menu and prompt
* Session is in memory
* Cli is through http post
* Started with jweb displaying main menu
* copied config to config/... and wrote test program for user actions (app not yet using this)
* added templates to Text
* updated japp API to respond with content
* updated jconsole to render content to text
* added cookies to jweb
* jweb worked with prompts and menus

Current:
* update jconsole to pass step in contReq

* make users store work in japp and check session mgt from jweb and jconsole
* (not auth - just session management with client id)
* let jsonsole store client id and re-use
* e.g. MSISDN/username for auth is entered by user, verified and must be stored for the client id on the server - not on client

Next
* change jconsole and jweb to use not japp API + render proper content as text/html
* sessions must expire
* use cookies for user id, or command line in jconsole - can set various fields in cookie/config - app should start with random user if not specified.
* console and web must display content correctly
* fake service call in config_test and use output
* Show menu + select links in web - need to get details from app...
* then show prompts as forms
* jconsole must start without input to request main menu
* jweb does not make selection or get input
* japp to respond with temp item to show error
* also need to support service calls and external content from the app
* but keep as simple as possible
* dynamic choice lists will be needed
* input validation rules in client (repeat in japp to be sure, but allow client to validate too)
* add another user to reflect e.g. richer html
* japp to make service calls
* use session data in the app calls and text substitution
* add messages final/intermediate (with [ok] to proceed)
* add a form to submit, console must enter form and complete all prompts and allow to go back
* add useful services, e.g. db, redis, email, sms, lists, groups, bookings, ...
* make content items extensible, e.g. to add date inputs and other things with non-simple text values
* router to select apps from a menu
* jsessions from a service call, shared by multiple services, with expiry, user counts, list of users + when etc.
* mobile app

First Apps:
* event + entry (without login)
* group + join + communicate (without login)
* auth service to be used in other services
* black-white service
